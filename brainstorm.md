    - Scope: V1 would allow users to set a radius of distance as well as type of cuisine. V2 would expand their preferences and include the ability to save these restaurants; there would be an option to randomly pick out of these in case they do not want to eat something new.
- NYC Subway Tracking

    - Market: NYC subway riders
    - Habit: Daily, since subway riders usually have to ride the subway to every location.
    - Scope: V1 would allow users to add subway stations they regularly use. V2 would add a subway map (kind of like Underway) that has all the subway stops and the ability to view the times of the stops.
- Duolingo but you learn languages through songs
    - Description: Sing along to songs and practice your language learning skills
    - Category: Education
    - Mobile: Mobile devices allow users to learn anytime, anywhere. With a language learning app focused on songs, users can practice their language skills during commutes, while exercising, or in any spare moment they have throughout the day.
